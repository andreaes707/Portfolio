<h2 id="CuriosityLearning" class="text-uppercase">Creativity, Curiosity, and Learning; A Tried &amp; True Partnership</h2>

 <p class="">I spend a lot of time researching and writing articles, also coding the occasional
   random template; I even study even when I have yet to go back to school.
   In broad terms I choose to study science, math, art & music; Crochet and knitting
   are my favorite art activities, as well as sketching.</p>


 <p class="">Around every corner in <em class="uL">every</em> subject, there is <span class="uL"><em>always</em>
   something <strong><em>new</em> </strong>to learn</span>.</p>

<h3 class="" id="hobbiesLearning"><em><strong>My Hobbies and Learning</strong></em></h3>

<p class=""><em>Only be open to learn if you are truly open to the idea of learning itself!</em>
  While I love <em>learning </em>at my <strong><em>core</em></strong>, it is truly my <strong>
    <em>curiosity </em></strong>that drives my desire for experience and knowledge.</p>

<h3 class="" id="curiosityTruth"><em><strong>Curiosity &amp; Truth</strong></em></h3>

<p class=""><em>My curiosity <strong>motivates</strong> me towards my goals and even allows
  me to do what might seem <strong>improbable</strong>.</em>

 I know I am overstating this when I say my <strong>curiosity</strong> goes beyond restraint,
   every little thing that I hold <strong><em>interest</em></strong> in I always
   <strong class="uL">love</strong> to learn the <em>specifics,</em> those imperfect
   details that I never knew about before.</p>

 <p class="">You already know that I love quotes, sometimes I definitely overuse them.
   They are words of wisdom, of <em>guidance</em>, a bit of <em>clarity</em>. <em>Quotes
     also bring the simple truth to light when all is dark and clouded.</em></p>

<figure class="">
<blockquote class="text-uppercase"><p><em><strong>I have no special talent. I am only
  passionately curious.</strong></em></p>
  <cite><em>~ Albert Einstein</em></cite>
</blockquote>
</figure>

<h4 class="" id="imagination_problemSolving"><em><strong>Imagination and Problem-Solving</strong></em></h4>


 <p class="">Not only do I love learning, <em>I love spreading my love and curiosity</em>. I also
   love my <em><strong>imagination</strong></em>. Without having an imagination this wonderful and
   <em>unique</em> I would have not made it through all the negativity &amp; tough times in my life.</p>

<p><em><strong>Problem-solving is the best time to productively use the imagination.</strong></em> Every
  problem can be solved when you can take a <em><strong>step back</strong></em> and <em><strong class="uL">
    fully observe the bigger picture</strong></em> and <strong><em>learn</em> </strong>something
    <em>important</em> from it. Observe the mistakes and flaws and compensate within reason.
    <span class="uL text-uppercase">You can always <em>learn </em>but <em><strong>understanding
    </strong></em>doesn't always come <em>easy</em>.</span></p>


<h4 class="" id="intuitionEmotions"><em>Intuition &amp; Emotions</em></h4>

<p>Emotional problems are even <em>tougher</em> to find a decent solution - especially when you are
  personally involved since your emotions, thoughts, feelings merge into a cloud of confusion. A cloud
  that disguises your best judgement, deeply affecting even your best understanding &amp; intuition.</p>

<p>We can always find a way through the path of learning - <a href="http://Emotions">Learn how to Grow
  Your Mindset - Learn To Understand Your Emotions Better</a>, in this blog I talk about how emotions
  affect us constantly using my knowledge and the resources linked through the page. <a href="http://Resources">

<h2 class="">WHO I AM</h2>

<h3 class="">And How I Perceive The World Around Me</h3>

 <p class="">First of all I want to let you know a few things:</p>

 <p class="">I am an intuitive being full of love and optimism and I love all that I do. Some people might see my strong passion for all that I do as slight insanity.</p>

 <p class="">It is especially hard to be passionate about many things without letting go of the positivity those many activities hold.</p>

<h3>Wisdom, Love &amp; Patience</h3>

 <p class="">Being insane is just another personal perspective especially when even the insane have sanity in the <em>impossible</em>.</p>

 <p class="">Honest men know that no wise man is considered sane forever. My preferential type of insanity is happiness.</p>

<figure class="">
<blockquote><p>Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you had in mind.</p><p><cite>~ <span class="uppercase">David G. Allen</span></cite></p><p><cite>~ <span class="uppercase">David G. Allen</span></cite></p></blockquote>
</figure>

 <p class="">Although I have lived with plenty of love in my life I have still had some of the best love &amp; experiences taken from me by my own choices.</p>

 <p class="">Remember that you must respect anyone wiser than you, know your manners even through the most difficult times.</p>


<p>That being said I still prefer to live a life full of love understanding rather than a life with any lies. Our experience gives us strength through time, patience and commitment.</p>

<hr class="">

<h2>Life Lessons &amp; Choices</h2>

 <p class="">I have been alive 20 years now, two decades worth of <strong><em>choices</em></strong>. Choices that were <em>beneficial</em>, good decisions or not, <em>sometimes choices hurt no matter what</em>. Our choices and mistakes are a part of life, a part of who we are yet they do not directly define us and they certainly do not confine us.</p>

<p>The first 10 years was just observing, practicing and mastering the skills I knew, but when do we realize that we have the option: at a point in our life, we can choose to keep learning or we stick to a specific skill set acquired by youth through parents &amp; mentors.</p>

<p>Easy said when someone is <em>young </em>and already used to learning almost every day (probably every day if they find it fun or <em>interesting</em>). Older people don't wanna learn not just because it is <em>tough effort</em> but it also is <em>rather exhausting for the <strong>mentality </strong>of their <strong>age </strong>group and <strong>level of experience</strong>.</em> Everyone can choose to learn again only if they believe they can and actually <em>want</em> to experience learning again.</p>

<section class="row text-right text-wrap flex-wrap">

    <article class="col-md">
  <p class="">I feel like my imagination allows me to remain in good judgement when problems arise.Imagination
    allows so many possibilities and fantasies to emerge into the world through our minds, hands and bodies.</p>

    <p class="">I use my free time to constantly meditate, relax, and doodle to keep my energies in harmonious balance.</p>

    <figure class="bg-success text-dark">
      <blockquote><p>The gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.</p>
        <cite><span class="text-uppercase">~ Albert Einstein</span></cite>
      </figure>

      <p class="">Wisdom ultimately comes from patience, trust, respect in equilibrium.</p>

      <p>Remaining calm, understanding your <em>best virtues</em> and letting your intuition be a positive guide.
        <em>Wisdom comes from experience</em> (not just your own) and well learnt lessons come to us throughout life.
        Being cognizant to all around you, no harmful judgement.</p>

<h3>Love &amp; Compassion All The Way</h3>

 <p class="">I am a lifelong student of <em>many</em> studies and I love nothing more than my family, my communities, and mother nature as well as all who sustain Earth. I am creatively passionate about <em>everything</em> I do, from home to work.</p>

 <p class="">Life lessons need to be learnt, even when they broke me I continued directly forward. Onward through a path filled with light among all the darkness. <strong><em><span class="uppercase">I AM Loyal only to the brightness of love forever, wherever I go love &amp; compassion go with me.</span></em></strong></p>

 <p class="">When I was lost I barely found the support I needed to survive but all was not completely lost. Those decisions we have the option to make are our building blocks, and other vast important life pieces.</p>

<h3>Having Faith</h3>

<h4>..Makes Surviving &amp; understanding those Life Lessons Better</h4>

 <p class="">I have had my fair share of life problems, not having important pieces had destroyed my life at one point, it became a literal <em><strong>pile</strong></em> of <em><s>shit</s></em>. And I was young and for having a whole future ahead of me it wasn't the best thing that the whole train derailed before I even reached adulthood.</p>

<p>I had some hope, enough <strong>faith</strong> to survive and with the proper support, my decision to continue living <em>normal</em> life happened, this is not where or when I explain my full story but our pasts help us get to the future once we accept what happened &amp; observe what is, as well as acknowledging our hardships.</p>

<p>We must also be willing to move on and keep renewing our faith in the world, renewing our ability to <em>adapt</em>, to <em>accept different perspectives</em>, be more <em>compassion</em>ate, find a way to actually <em>understand</em> what is <strong>important</strong>.</p>


 <p class="">We choose who we are, who we want to be, what we will reach for, our achievements, our experiences, our path through the growth of life.</p>

<figure class="">

</figure>

<hr class="">

 <p class="">The next few paragraphs describe how emotions affect us a little, some of my current struggles, and then I explain what my studies and hobbies are.</p>


<p class="">At our center we not only have a soul, but a body capable of <em><strong>intense</strong> uncontrollable emotions</em>. Emotions, feelings we feel <em>every</em> day, we <em>grow</em> up with them, we <em>learn </em>them, learn <em>with</em> them, <em><strong>misinterpret </strong></em>them and the cycle continues. <em>They directly impact our actions, help us figure out what is <strong>right </strong>or <strong>wrong</strong>.</em> What is simply <em><strong>nonsense</strong></em> and what actually makes <strong><em>sense</em></strong>.</p>

<p>While I was younger (around 15) I had basic life <em>responsibilities </em>to deal with and I lived <em>independently </em>(when it came to surviving day-to-day I was doing most of it <em>alone or with friends</em>). As well as through the support of my parents as well as other family and friends. A lot of my survival was <em>common sense</em> and the knowledge I gained throughout my childhood.</p>

<p>Through that time while remaining fairly healthy and nearly healed in the physical way, I was going through a ton of <em><strong>severe</strong> mental issues from various traumatic incidents</em> and even I know that some incidents could have been avoided.</p>


 <p class="">Not saying that any should have been avoided due to their <em><strong>valuable </strong>lessons</em>. Every mistake made has contributed to giving me new knowledge and new perspectives to become a better and more aware person.</p>


<p class="">Those <em>various incidents</em> are a few different stories to be shared within the reasonable future. Overall every incident counted toward making me more committed and determined to be the best entrepreneur, stranger, friend, teacher, mother, companion, wife, and philosopher. Although the hell I went through wasn't a physical problem at first it has now become a problem in the form of an unknown epileptic disorder that has been controlling parts of my life for over 2 years now.</p>

 <p class="">I have finally broken through my severe problems and I finally get the chance to properly rehabilitate my mind and body, for me this gives me a new start to an <strong>exciting journey</strong>.</p>

 <p class="">Given the circumstances, my life has not ever been this <em>stable</em>. But my terms of stable are actually quite <strong><em>unstable</em></strong> since my home is my family. <em>My <span style="text-decoration:underline;">family</span></em> are <strong>my <em>life</em></strong> whether or not we have food, clothes, a roof or other <em>luxuries</em>.</p>

<p>Life is apparently a luxury that can not be afforded even with all the love you have to give. I have always appreciated clothes, food and a roof more than anything else when I needed it most. Some helped when even they couldn't afford to, putting themselves at risk for someone as broken as I was.</p>


 <p class="">Truly faith, respect and patience kept me &amp; my shrinking faith alive. Those who all gave honestly, help, and wisdom, helped me become who I really am. I currently keep surprising myself with my ability to keep up with the daily rehabilitation of my body and mind.</p>

</figure>

<p>No matter how much people disagree or disrespect you, their judgement can not ever harm you. Those words they say only express their opinion not the facts that matter.</p>


 <p class="">I am a rare butterfly; I have chosen to express myself however I feel <em><b>within</b> the constraints of positivity &amp; integrity.</em> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kindly kill your enemies with compassion and love on your journey to finding your true self.</span></p>


 <p class="">If you choose to bury yourself in your cocoon sooner than most you best be sure to always let all your true colors shine. Emerge from the darkness brighter than you could have imagined before your transformation.</p>

<p>I am a young passionate philosopher, a lover of wisdom, learning, understanding, honesty, and loyalty who loves to use imagination and curiosity actively in daily life.</p>
</section>
<section class="col-md">


<p class="">Using my imagination daily allows me to maintain complete positivity and remain calm in various situations. I am driven by using my integrity which to me means I have to use the truth, be honest and be respectful, all in an equal balance.</p>


<p class="">My beliefs also inspire my enthusiasm and optimism for everything I do. I am compassionate to all living things since they are all a part of nature. Nature is the beauty of our physical world. We must do what we can to nurture and promote health to all living things.</p>

<h2>What do I believe in?</h2>



<p>I am open-minded enough to believe in many different religions, rituals, and cultures. Each one is unique and spiritually serves a "higher purpose" within Earth, connecting our world with worlds next to us. I love philosophy and astronomy and I'm empowered to seek out the truth and understand everything fascinating in our world</p>


<p>When talking about music, all I can really say is that my world is "driven" by music. Music allows immense concentration to all tasks especially when work becomes problematic.</p>
