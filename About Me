 <p>My name is Andrea Estrada, I am a young student that enjoys to fill my days with study & research
and my spare time with my very different hobbies. </p>

<p class="">I am overly compassionate &amp; I absolutely <strong>
   <em>love</em></strong> knitting, crochet, yoga,<br> reading, also
   video games are awesome and animals
   are too majestic to ingnore.
   <p class="">I have chosen to live with compassion for all living things. As
     well<br> as to live with a heart full of light, positivity and possibilities.</p>
   <p class="text-right">That does not mean that my life has only been full of
     positivity. For<br> positivity and negativity have an unseen balance; An equal connection
     of harmony between cause and effect.</p>
     <p class="AuL text-center">Where one exists so does the other.</p>
